Feb 14,2023 - Friday 

I had some regrets going into the Swift Student Challenge as I knew about it long before I started developing but never took initiative to submit my own and this year is the last year for me as a student but today I feel nothing but excitement for the winner announcement.

got a MacBook from my sister's friend after I put up a story seeking the laptop on Instagram; in Decemeber - talk about initiative! Turns out he had a boxed M1 sitting in the bag not even signed in or set-up? I struck gold! jumped on it as soon as possible and customized the whole thing Don style. Also this was the first time I was using a mac let alone developing in Swift. The journey has been absolutely thrilling!

Immediately started developing the app with a solid idea in mind and gave it 3 weeks but ended up changing the app twice out of which the second was a gpt suggestion! I just wanted to submit participate and develop an application but the initial idea was too complex for a mvp student app and the second one just felt forced. 
then came the project I am already working on for while now, which, I can't wait to launch (i am very close).

not only did it serve as the perfect mvp for the challenge but potentially a soft launch (if I win) best part? I made the whole thing in just 5 days out of pure joy and given the fact that I knew exactly what I wanted from the app and it turned out to be PERFECT; even inspired several upgrades in the main app.

the main excitement comes from the app being equal parts creative, fun and utilitarian, AND it is kind of a super hit or a complete miss which is multiplying the thrill as I am writing this! 
WHEN ARE THE WINNERS ANNOUNCED !?

P.S: I lost and it made me think again
